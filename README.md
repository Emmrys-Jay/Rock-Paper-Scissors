This project is my first javaScript project implemented from the Odin Project's course on foundations of web development.

I applied practical skills such as:

- Functions definition and declaration
- Loops
- Accepting user input
- Accepting function return values
- Using the random function etc.

This project implements a popular game "Rock-paper-scissors" between a player and the computer. Each game consists of five rounds.
